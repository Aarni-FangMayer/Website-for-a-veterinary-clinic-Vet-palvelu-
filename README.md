# Finn-Veterinary OY — Veterinary Clinic Website

A responsive, multilingual frontend website created for a real veterinary clinic in Finland.  
The project was developed as a learning exercise with a strong focus on layout, UI/UX, and foundational React concepts.

> ⚠️ Note: The clinic is real, but the website was created as a personal pet project and was not officially adopted by the company.

## 🐾 Project Overview

This project is a single-page website (landing page) designed for a small veterinary clinic to present services and collect appointment requests via a contact form.

The main goals of the project were:
- Practicing responsive layout and UI design
- Learning React fundamentals (including class-based components)
- Implementing multilingual support
- Building reusable UI components without external UI libraries

---

## ✨ Features

- Fully responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Multilingual support (4 languages):
  - Finnish
  - English
  - Swedish
  - Russian
- Services list with pricing displayed in a carousel
- Appointment request / contact form
- Form validation
- Modal windows and burger menu with state management
- Clean, minimal UI designed from scratch

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- HTML
- CSS (Grid & Flexbox)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- React (class-based components)
- Vite

**Styling:**
- CSS Modules
- Fully responsive layout without external UI libraries

**Design:**

## 🧱 Architecture & Approach

- Single-page landing website (SPA-like structure)
- Component-based architecture
- Reusable UI components (buttons, cards, heading groups, sections)
- React Context API used for global language management
- State used for UI interactions (modals, navigation menu)

> This project intentionally uses class-based React components to better understand legacy React patterns and be prepared to work with existing codebases.
